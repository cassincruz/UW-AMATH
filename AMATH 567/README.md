# AMATH 567 - Applied Complex Analysis

## Syllabus
This is the first of a sequence of three courses at the graduate Ph.D. level on methods of applied mathematics.  The topics covered here will be useful for the other two courses in the sequence.  (The Masters level sequence is AMATH 501, 502 and 503; there is some overlap of material as PhD students are not required to take AMATH 501).  Although we will start from the beginning, the topics will advance more rapidly than an undergraduate or Master-level course, and we will cover more application topics. These include branch cuts and contour integrals around branch cuts; evaluation of real integrals and improper integrals by converting them to contour integrals in the complex plane; Fourier and Laplace transforms and their inverses; Asymptotic evaluation of integrals (to be continued in [AMATH 568](/AMATH%20568/README.md)); Harmonic functions, conformal mapping and applications.
