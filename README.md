This repository contains all of my course files and assignments.

## Highlights

- I opted to take the PhD level *Methods of Applied Mathematics* series ([AMATH 567](/AMATH%20567/README.md), [AMATH 568](/AMATH%20568/README.md), and [AMATH 569](/AMATH%20569/README.md)) rather than the Masters level, and attained an average grade of 3.83.
- [AMATH 573](/AMATH%20573/README.md) is another PhD level course taught by the department head ([Bernard Deconinck](https://depts.washington.edu/bdecon/bernard/)) which is offered once every couple of years and covers analytical techniques for finding exact solutions to nonlinear wave equations such as KdV, such as the inverse scattering transform. Subsequent quarters delved deeper into this rich area of mathematics via ungraded weekly lecture groups on finite genus solutions to KdV, and more. 
- I took [AMATH 562 - Advanced Stochastic Processes](/AMATH%20562/README.md) after skipping the prerequisite *AMATH 561 - Introduction to Probability and Random Processes* course. I had no formal background in measure theory or random processes outside of some personal research I'd done the years prior, but I knew I this would be my only opportunity to take this course, so I took a leap of faith. This was the most challenging class I took during my degree, with an especially challenging take-home [final exam](/AMATH%20562/Final%20exam/562_Final.pdf), but it ended up being one of my favorite classes and I'm happy with my performance.
